Other features to add:
- When there is a bad imput program restarts and user is prompted to add a number another time (rather than exiting a program)
- Allow user to select stuff with arrows
- Create unit tests

v2 (Plan)
- Implement support for floating point arithmetics

v1.5 (Plan)
- Support signed division
- Support 2 digit inputs
- Code cleanup

v1.4 (Developed 2025-06-16 - 2025-06-28)
- Supports 1-digit signed numbers (except for division)
    - Support for +1/-1 inputs without throwing an ERROR
    - Print brackets around singed input numbers
    - Implement signed support for ADD, SUB and MUL
- Improvements:
    - 2 digit result is printed properly (e.g. 8*8 does not return giberish). Before you were limited to your output being no more than 9
    - Full equation is printed in the output (to make it easier to wrap signed inputs in brackets)
    - Code made more modular by creating data.asm and functions.asm

v1.3
Improvements:
- Code comments added
- Macro for input check
- Add flush check logic to remove bug that previously required to press ENTER two times before seeing an ERROR message about input being too long

v1.1 (Developed 2025-06-08 - 2025-06-13)
- 4 operations
- It can only handle single digit imput and output
    - e.g., 4+5 will work
    - e.g., 5+6 will not work since the output is 2 digits
